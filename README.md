# Graph_in_a_Shell
Allows you to graph single variable functions in your terminal and print at variable speed.
The function should use the variable x and the awk formatting. The -c paramater should always be used to clear the terminal, which helps with the overall formatting of the graph.

Ex: **graph_printer -x 20 -y 20 -s 5 -c**
